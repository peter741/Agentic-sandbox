# Development Guide

## Prerequisites

- Go toolchain
- Docker daemon
- systemd (Linux, for running agboxd as a user service)

## Network Isolation Privileges

On Linux, the daemon requires `CAP_NET_ADMIN` to manage nftables rules for sandbox network isolation. The install script grants this automatically:

```bash
sudo setcap cap_net_admin+ep $(which agboxd)
```

On macOS, no additional privileges are needed.

## Test Targets

| Target | Scope | Privileges |
|--------|-------|------------|
| `make test` | Unit tests + mock tests | None |
| `make integration-test` | Real daemon integration tests | `CAP_NET_ADMIN` (granted via `sudo -n setcap`) |

For daily development, `make test` is sufficient. Run `make integration-test` for full verification including network isolation.

## Build

Build both binaries:

```bash
go build ./cmd/...
# outputs: .build/agboxd  .build/agbox
```

## Running the Daemon

Build from source, install to `~/.local/bin/`, and start the systemd user service (Linux) or launchd agent (macOS):

```bash
./scripts/install_local.sh
```

Service management:

```bash
systemctl --user status agboxd
systemctl --user restart agboxd
journalctl --user -u agboxd -f
```

After code changes, re-run `./scripts/install_local.sh` to rebuild and restart.

## Proto Generation

Go and Python bindings are generated from `api/proto/service.proto` using pinned tool versions:

| Tool | Version |
|------|---------|
| protoc | v6.31.1 (release tag v31.1) |
| protoc-gen-go | v1.36.11 |
| protoc-gen-go-grpc | v1.6.1 |
| grpcio-tools | from `sdk/python` dev dependencies |

Regenerate bindings:

```bash
bash scripts/generate_proto.sh
```

The script downloads and caches protoc in `.local/protoc/` (project-local, git-ignored) and installs Go plugins in `.local/go-bin/`. CI runs `scripts/lints/check_proto_consistency.sh` automatically through `run_test.sh lint` to ensure checked-in bindings stay in sync with the proto source.

## Tests

```bash
./scripts/run_test.sh
```
